# Summary:

-> Setters (setCount, setBakes): These are used to update state and trigger re-renders. They are functions provided by useState.

-> useCallback: This hook is used to memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components by ensuring the function reference remains the same unless its dependencies change....useCallback is all about optimization and ensuring that functions are not recreated unnecessarily, which can help improve performance in React applications, especially when dealing with complex components or a large component tree.

-> Context api, Benefits of Using Context API
Avoids Prop Drilling: Eliminates the need to pass props through intermediate components.

- context is like a global variable


- Reusability: You can now use the <Select> component wherever you need a dropdown.


# FLOW of this project covered below:

1. Components: Create modular components for different parts of your UI.
   
2. States and Props: Manage component state (useState) for dynamic data and use props to pass data between components.

3. Context API: Implement context (useContext, useReducer) for managing global state or sharing data across components.

4. Hooks: Use hooks (useEffect, useCallback) for managing side effects and optimizing performance.

5. Routing: Set up routing (React Router) to navigate between different views/pages in your application.

6. API Integration: Fetch data from APIs using fetch or libraries like Axios to interact with backend services.

7. CSS and Styling: Style your components and pages using CSS, Sass, or CSS-in-JS for a visually appealing UI.

8. UI Polishing: Refine the UI for responsiveness, accessibility, and user experience.

9. Header and Footer Links: Include navigation links in headers and footers to enhance user navigation.

This comprehensive flow covers everything from component creation to final UI touches and navigation setup, ensuring a thorough approach to developing React.js applications.
